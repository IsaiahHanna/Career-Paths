# Unlocking Career Pathways: Advanced Analysis of BC Student Outcomes

Context
 
Students who come to study in British Columbia often face uncertainty due to many factors to consider, and not all have a clear idea of what to pursue. However, everyone aims for a bright future and stable employment after graduation. With todayâ€™s unpredictable economy, understanding the factors that influence employment outcomes has become even more important. By analyzing these factor, we aim to uncover insights through advanced techniques like predictive modelling, clustering, and benchmarking. This will help both institutions and students make more informed decisions about programs that lead to better job prospects and long-term success.

p.s. the dataset can still be used outside the BCStats Student Outcomes Viewer because it allows for more advanced, customized analyses which the viewer doesn't offer. It enables deeper, exploratory data manipulation and visualization tailored to specific needs

Problem Statement
 
The choice for the problem depends on the approach of the team:

[Predictive Modeling] - How can we predict the likelihood of post-graduation employment and salary outcomes for students based on factors such as program type, institution, and demographic information, to provide early interventions for students at risk of unemployment or low wages

[Clustering and Segmentation] - How can we segment students into distinct groups based on their post-graduation outcomes (e.g., employment status, salary, further studies) and demographic data to identify trends and patterns that can help institutions provide more tailored support?

[Benchmarking and Comparative Analysis] - How do different institutions and programs compare in terms of employment rates, salary outcomes, and further studies, and how can we use these comparisons to set benchmarks and improve institutional performance and student outcomes?
